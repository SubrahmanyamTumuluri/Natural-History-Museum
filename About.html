			<p>Founded in 1954, the San Diego State University Natural History Society was established to document and preserve the rich history and natural resources of the Southern California and the Baja region. In its initial years, the Society supported the region's scientific culture, serving a small but growing community eager for information about its natural resources. </p>																	<p>Since its formation society members have established a campus weather station, served as preservation volunteers for Torrey Pines State Reserve, Batiquitos Lagoon Foundation Nature Center, Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and other nature preserves in the region, and garnered support for the San Diego Zoological Society. </p>
			<p>The Society's crowning accomplishment is the creation of the San Diego State University Natural History Museum, the only university affiliated Natural History Museum in the south west.</p>
